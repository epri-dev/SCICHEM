Examples provided with the SCICHEM 3.3 package

Brief descriptions of the four example cases provided with the  
distribution are given below. The examples are hypothetical and  
are provided for illustrative purposes so that the user can test  
the setup of the model and run through the tutorials. For additional  
details please refer to the "Tutorial" section (Appendix A) of the User's Guide.

1) so2_2005: This is an annual 1-hour SO2 example with no chemistry and a  
hypothetical SO2 source. This example uses keyword format input files.

2) no2_mc_2005: This is an annual 1-hour NO2 example with an optimized NO-NO2-O3  
chemistry mechanism for near-source calculations and a hypothetical NOx source.  
This example also uses keyword format input files.

3) tva: This is a one-day case study with the full photochemical mechanism (CB6r2)  
and hypothetical SO2 and NOx emissions for power plant plume impacts on downwind ozone.  
The example uses the location of the TVA Cumberland power plant located in northwestern  
Tennessee. This example uses namelist type input files.
c
4) SW_ss: This is a multi-day power plant plume case study with the full  
photochemical mechanism and aerosol and aqueous-phase chemistry for ozone  
and secondary PM2.5 impacts. This example uses 3-D meteorology fields based on WRF  
outputs processed with MMF and hypothetical SO2 and NOx emissions. The power plant
is located in the Four Corners region in the southwestern US. This example uses namelist
type input files.
